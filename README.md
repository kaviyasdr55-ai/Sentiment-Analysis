# Description

## 🔹 Sentiment Analysis Using NLP
This project demonstrates Sentiment Analysis on textual data (such as reviews) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning. The goal is to classify text as positive or negative sentiment.

## 📌 Project Overview
Preprocessed raw text data using NLP techniques such as lowercasing, stopword removal, and stemming.
Converted text into numerical features using Bag of Words (CountVectorizer).
Built and trained a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment.
Evaluated the model using accuracy score and classification report.
Tested the model on new unseen text inputs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NLTK
Scikit-learn

## 📂 Project Workflow
Data creation and exploration
Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stemming)
Feature extraction using CountVectorizer
Model training using Multinomial Naive Bayes
Model evaluation and prediction
Insight generation

## 📊 Results & Insights
The model successfully classifies text sentiment as positive or negative.
Accuracy may be low due to the small dataset, but the project demonstrates the complete NLP pipeline.
This project can be extended using larger datasets or advanced models.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
Use a larger real-world dataset (tweets or reviews)
Apply TF-IDF vectorization
Try advanced models like Logistic Regression or LSTM
